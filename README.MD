App fetches 18 random employees (us nationality) from an api. 

You can click on an employee to see more information about them.

I have added a way to filter the directory by name. To do this, I needed to adjust my API request to retrieve a user nationality that would only return data in the English alphabet.

I added a toggle method to switch back and forth between employees.

A search bar has been dynamically added to the page to filter employees by name.

Load different employees button reloads page to retrieve a new and random set of employees
