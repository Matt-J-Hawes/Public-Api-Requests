App fetches 12 random employees (us nationality) from an api. 

I have added a way to filter the directory by name. To do this, I needed to adjust my API request to retrieve a user nationality that would only return data in the English alphabet.

I added a toggle method to switch back and forth between employees.

A search bar has been dynamically added to the page to filter employees by name.

I have changed the colour scheme on the app to a yellow and blue contrast. I also dynamically added an 'X' on the search bar to clear the input value and show all employees.
